# 🌱 DS: Data Science Predictive Models

Welcome to **ds**, a growing collection of data science projects focused on predictive modeling. This repository is currently home to a regression model that predicts outcomes based on soil data, with more models and projects to be added in the future.

## 🌟 Overview

This repository showcases my work in developing predictive models, starting with a regression model designed to predict certain outcomes from soil characteristics. The aim is to build accurate, interpretable models that can be applied to real-world scenarios.

## 📂 Repository Structure

Here’s what you’ll find inside:

- **[Soil Data Regression Model](./regression)**
  - **Goal**: Predict a target variable based on soil features.
  - **Techniques**: Linear Regression, polynomial regression models of degree 3 and 9, Feature Engineering, Cross-Validation.
  - **Data**: Includes soil properties like fraction of transpirable soil water, and measure of relative leaf growth.
  - **Outcome**: A model that provides accurate predictions for soil-related outcomes.

## 🚀 Getting Started

To explore the soil data regression model:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ds.git
